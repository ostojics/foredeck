# Market Research for MVP Validation

## 1. Research Objectives

- Validate MVP features against real user needs and pain points
- Ensure the product addresses critical problems for target users

## 2. Key Research Questions

- Who are the primary users (employees, managers, HR leads)?
- What are their top pain points with current vacation/time-off management?
- Which features are most valuable to them (e.g., real-time schedules, notifications, dashboards)?
- How do current solutions fall short?
- What motivates users to switch to a new solution?
- What are the must-have vs. nice-to-have features for MVP?

## 3. Methodology

- Desk research: Review industry reports, HR tech blogs, and SaaS adoption trends
- Competitor analysis: Compare leading tools (e.g., BambooHR, Timetastic, FactorialHR)
- User interviews: Conduct 5-10 interviews with employees and managers
- Online surveys: Distribute to a broader audience for quantitative feedback
- Synthesize findings into actionable insights

## 4. Findings

### 4.1 User Needs & Personas

- **Persona 1: Employee**
  - Needs: Simple vacation request, clear schedule view, fast approvals
  - Pain points: Confusing processes, lack of transparency, slow feedback
- **Persona 2: Manager/Lead**
  - Needs: Team capacity overview, easy approval/rejection, threshold alerts
  - Pain points: Manual tracking, risk of overbooking, unclear policies

### 4.2 Competitor Analysis

| Competitor  | Features                                 | Pricing | Strengths               | Weaknesses               |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------ |
| BambooHR    | PTO tracking, approvals, analytics       | $$$     | Mature, integrations    | Expensive, complex       |
| Timetastic  | Simple requests, calendar, notifications | $$      | Easy to use, affordable | Limited analytics        |
| FactorialHR | HR suite, time-off, docs, analytics      | $$-$$$  | All-in-one, dashboards  | May be overkill for SMBs |

### 4.3 Market Trends

- Shift to remote/hybrid work increases need for transparent, digital time-off tools
- SMBs seek affordable, easy-to-use solutions
- Emphasis on employee experience and self-service

### 4.4 Pricing Models

- Per-user/month SaaS pricing is standard
- Entry-level: $1-3/user/month (Timetastic)
- Mid-market: $5-10/user/month (BambooHR, FactorialHR)

### 4.5 Adoption Barriers

- Resistance to change from manual/spreadsheet processes
- Concerns about data privacy and integrations
- Budget constraints for smaller teams

## 5. Synthesis & Insights

- MVP features align with top user needs: simplicity, transparency, fast feedback
- Opportunity: Focus on delightful UX and onboarding to differentiate from legacy tools
- Risk: Overbuilding analytics or multi-tenancy for MVP; keep initial scope tight

## 6. Recommendations

- Prioritize simple request/approval flows and clear dashboards for MVP
- Use playful, engaging UX as a differentiator
- Target SMBs and teams frustrated with spreadsheets or clunky HR tools
- Plan user interviews and surveys to validate assumptions before finalizing MVP scope
