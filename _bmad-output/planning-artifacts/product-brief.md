# Product Brief

**Project Name:** Foredeck  
**Date:** December 30, 2025

### What Problem Are We Solving?

Small and mid-sized businesses (SMBs) struggle with vacation/time-off management due to:

- Overly complex, expensive HR suites not tailored for their needs
- Manual, error-prone processes (spreadsheets, emails)
- Lack of real-time visibility into team capacity and absences
- Slow, confusing approval flows and poor onboarding
- Hidden costs and unclear pricing in existing solutions

### Our Solution

Foredeck is a focused, playful, and easy-to-use SaaS platform for SMBs to manage time-off and team capacity.  
We deliver:

- Delightful, mobile-friendly UX with playful copy and micro-interactions (e.g., confetti on approval)
- Fast, transparent request/approval flows for employees and managers
- Real-time team calendars and capacity dashboards
- Seamless onboarding and migration from spreadsheets
- Transparent, per-user pricing with no hidden fees

### Why Now?

- Remote/hybrid work is the norm, making digital, self-service tools essential
- SMBs demand consumer-grade UX and affordable, focused products
- Market research shows a gap for “fun, fast, and friendly” time-off tools for small teams
